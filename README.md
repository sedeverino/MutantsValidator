# Mutants Validator

In this project we are gonna get through the solution to find out if a human is mutant or not, implementing the method required and some extra features

# Requirements

"Magneto needs to recruit as many mutants as possible to be able to fight against the X-Men.
To accomplish this, he has asked us to create a program with a method or function with the following signature:
  boolean isMutant(String[] dna);
This method will receive an array of Strings as a parameter, each representing a row in a (NxN) table with the DNA sequence. 
The characters in the Strings can only be: (A, T, C, G), which represent each nitrogenous base in DNA.
We will know a human is mutant, if we found out a secuence of 4 equal letters (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) more than once."
